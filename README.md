# Priority-CPU-Simulation
University assignment.  Write a program to demonstrate priority CPU job scheduling.

## How to use
Just clone the repo and run the PrioritySim.java file.

### Why this thing?
This is one of the first tricky assignments I was given when I started this whole computer science business. I like looking at how sloppy it is and reflecting back on my understanding of things then.
